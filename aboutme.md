I’m broadly interested in the ecology and evolution of species interactions, especially those in symbiotic relationships (whether they’re mutualistic, parasitic, or somewhere in between). I’m also interested in how these interactions play out in different populations facing different pressures/partners. Additionally, interested in the role that the microbiome interactions play in potentially modulating these processes. I come from a diverse background thinking largely about ecological questions, but trying to frame them in the tools of genetics (lots of molecular work) and evolution (specifically phylogenetics).

I am originally from the East Coast, but did my undergraduate work at the University of Chicago (AB ’12). I then moved to Austin, TX, to work as a lab manager at UT Austin. I’m now a fifth-year PhD candidate in the Population Biology Graduate Group at UC Davis.
